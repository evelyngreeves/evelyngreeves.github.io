    "text": "One of my first projects while working at STFC was a set of eight leaflets briefly summarising the various compute services offered by the Scientific Computing Department. The finished products were displayed on STFC’s stand at a major supercomputing conference in the US. A small selection can be seen below.\n\nWhat went well?\nThis project really helped me gain a deeper understanding of the many projects and services my department was involved in. It was a steep learning curve but I continued to refer back to the leaflets as long as I was working there - and gave copies to confused new graduate scheme students too!\nThese leaflets were designed not long after UKRI went through a major rebranding, giving all the research councils new logos and identities. I really enjoyed playing with the new brand guidelines to produce documents with a strong, interlinking visual identity.\n\n\nWhat were the challenges?\nThe target audience for the flyers was fairly technical, so they had to include a lot of detail that I struggled to understand. The ‘by numbers’ section on the back page was particularly tricky as I had no reference point for what was an impressive statistic. I relied quite heavily on the teams behind the services to tell me which figures would look most impressive!\nThis was my first real project in Adobe InDesign and I essentially taught myself to use it through trial, error and lots of Googling. It was worth it though - it’s a skill I continue to use to produce impressive-looking documents. I even designed my own wedding invitations in 2023.\n\n\nThe leaflets\n\n\n\nDownload PDF file.\n\n\nDownload PDF file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload PDF file.\n\n\nDownload PDF file."

    "section": "",
    "text": "I designed this poster for the University of York Biology Department’s Research Away Day in September 2022. The aim was to demonstrate how providing learners with more support at the early stages of learning command line programming can help them further down the line.\nWhen we ran our first Genomics course in autumn 2021, we discovered that a major sticking point for many participants was directory structure and navigation. This was making it really difficult to help people log into the cloud, where we could then teach them core command line skills. We spent much more time troubleshooting and going over these basic skills than we'd expected, meaning we had to rush through more complex content later on about analysis tools and pipelines. \nOverall, this meant our learners began their command line journey from a place of frustration (which has a huge impact on confidence) and we were forced to minimise the amount of time spent on the 'genomics' part of the Genomics course.\nAs a result, we split the original Genomics curriculum across two courses: Prenomics and Genomics. In Prenomics, all the focus is on the command line. We teach about files and directory structure, and spend lots of time guiding learners through creating a folder and navigating to it without using the command line. We also teach those crucial core skills - commonly used commands like ls, cd and mv. Later, as learners gain confidence, we move on to more complex commands like grep and redirection with &gt; and &gt;&gt;.\nThe poster itself is based on a previous poster I made about contents of Prenomics, but with an added section demonstrating that learners ended Genomics with a higher level of understanding across all three topic areas when Prenomics was offered as a separate course. They also saw a greater mean improvement in understanding when Prenomics was offered, especially for the Genomics topic - likely because more time was able to be dedicated to teaching these more complex ideas.\n\nMaking the poster\nI always enjoy graphic design and this was a fun challenge because it could be very bold and graphic, with lots of sections to fit together in a kind of jigsaw. I designed the icons in Adobe Illustrator and put the poster together in Adobe InDesign. The graphs at the bottom were made mostly in RStudio using ggplot2, with the axis labels and annotations added afterwards in Illustrator to get the fonts to match the rest of the poster (although I now know how to do this in ggplot!).\n\n\nThe finished product\n(click to enlarge)"
