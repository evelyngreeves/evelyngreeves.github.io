I really enjoy my job! It gives me opportunities to develop lots of skills, from data analysis to teaching to graphic design.\nI did my undergraduate degree in Biology at University of York, with a large focus on data analysis and genetics. For my dissertation I used text mining tools to map the topic landscape of gene editing before and after the advent of CRISPR-Cas9 as a gene editing tool, which was loads of fun.\nDuring my degree I did a placement year in the Scientific Computing Department at the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC). I spent the year working in communications - talking to scientists and producing leaflets, news articles and infographics about their research. I knew almost nothing about computing or physics when I went in, but I loved the challenge of learning something completely new!"

We would love a dog but currently have to compromise by doing lots of pet-sitting for friends and family. I also run a youth group for LGBTQ+ teenagers, which has its stressful moments but is incredibly rewarding.\n\n\n\nMy parents-in-laws’ beagle Daisy, one of our pet-sitting charges."
